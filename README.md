Starting in August 2021, new apps will need to:
- Publish with the Android App Bundle format.
- Use Play Asset Delivery or Play Feature Delivery to deliver assets or features that exceed download size of 150MB. Expansion files (OBBs) will no longer be supported for new apps.
- Target API level 30 (Android 11) or above and adjust for behavioral changes; except Wear OS apps, which must continue to target API level 28 or higher.
